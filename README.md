## Booking System
- I had to implement a full booking system, where I focused on allowing users to make bookings easily and efficiently and store then in MySQL database.
- Designed the system to handle user inputs, like selecting dates and times. Moreover, ensured the data was stored correctly and  ensures valid user booking with functionalieties such as checking foor rooms availability and user conflicts.
- A cancel feature was implemented so users can cancel their upcoming bookings easily!
## Admin Panel
- In my part, I was responsible for ensuring the logged in user was indeed an admin/faculty member.
- Based on that, they get privileges that allows them to add,delete and modify rooms and their schedules.
- Admin logs were also added, this ensures nonrepudation and keeps track of processes.
## Reporting and Analytics
## Additional Concepts

## Conclusion
The Room Booking System simplifies room reservations with features like real-time analytics, secure user accounts, and role-based access. It offers a clear and easy-to-use interface, and ensures smooth booking management.
